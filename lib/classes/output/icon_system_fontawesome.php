 * Class allowing different systems for mapping and rendering icons.
 *
 * Possible icon styles are:
 *   1. standard - image tags are generated which point to pix icons stored in a plugin pix folder.
 *   2. fontawesome - font awesome markup is generated with the name of the icon mapped from the moodle icon name.
 *   3. inline - inline tags are used for svg and png so no separate page requests are made (at the expense of page size).
